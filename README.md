# Conversational AI Workshop Project - July 2024
## Overview
This repository contains the code developed during the Conversational AI workshop held in July 2024. The project involves creating three individual agents using the Langchain library and Hugging Face API for the Stable Diffusion model. The agents work together to generate a fantasy-themed story, create a prompt describing a picture based on the story, and finally generate the picture.

## Agents
- Story Generator Agent: This agent receives a prompt and writes a fantasy-themed story.
- Prompt Generator Agent: This agent generates a descriptive prompt for the Picture Generator Agent based on the story from the Story Generator Agent.
- Picture Generator Agent: This agent generates the final picture based on the descriptive prompt using the Stable Diffusion model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Langchain library
- Hugging Face API
- Together API
